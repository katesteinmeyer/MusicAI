FEATURE 1: CREATE GROUP PLAYLIST 
**Individual Analysis
**
The AI starts by analyzing each person’s 
Apple Music history, focusing on:

Top Songs: Frequently played tracks.
Liked Genres: Genres with the highest play counts.
Favorite Artists: Artists most listened to.
Mood Tags (if available): Apple Music sometimes categorizes songs by mood, like "Chill,"
Exclusions: Any dislikes or skipped tracks


**Group Analysis
**
The AI then compares everyone’s preferences to find common ground:

Overlap Detection:
Identifies artists, genres, and songs that multiple people enjoy.
Example: If two friends love Taylor Swift, she gets a higher priority in the playlist.

Mood Balancing:
Considers the overall tone or mood, aligning with the trip's context.
Example: For a road trip, it might prioritize upbeat, high-energy songs over slower ballads.

Conflict Resolution:
Balances contrasting tastes by:
Alternating between genres/artists.
Including tracks that fuse genres (e.g., pop with country elements).
Adding “neutral” hits—popular songs likely to be enjoyed by everyone.

**Vibe Detection
**
To determine the group's vibe, the AI factors in:

Contextual Data:
User input, like a "road trip" theme selection or "vibes" sliders (e.g., energetic vs. chill).
Dynamic Adjustments:
Real-time suggestions based on detected preferences.
Example: If everyone leans toward upbeat music, the AI might skew the playlist toward dance or pop tracks.

**Playlist Curation
**
The AI creates a curated playlist by:
Selecting songs that cater to the group's preferences.
Sequencing them for a smooth flow:
Start with universally loved tracks to engage everyone.
Alternate moods or genres for variety.
Consider the trip’s duration for playlist length.
Tagging each track with a label like “Alex’s Pick” or “Everyone’s Favorite” to add a personal touch.

Dynamic Titles

Use AI to auto-generate a title based on group preferences: Example: If the group loves pop and rock, it could suggest "Pop Rock Roadshow.
